## Tech stack

React, Javascript, MUI, Firebase for hosting


### `Comment`

For now the project is written in JS, but I am currently learning Typescript and I plan on using it on daily basis.  <br />

Building this project was a lot of fun. With more time, I can see myself adding additional functionality such as integrating Redux, refactoring into TypeScript, implementing user authentication and database with Firebase, enabling editing of todos and mouse drag/drop capabilities, improving UI and animations, and making it mobile-friendly.

In my role at NN, I work with a variety of topics and technologies. Some of the notable ones include:

React, JS, soon TS, MUI, SASS, React Context, Redux, authentication with MSAL Azure library, posting and getting data from API, git actions, responsive design, communicating with UI/UX designers, discussing and planning intern react apps architecture. <br />

Also I was responsible for testing a new React component library with NN styles, developed by the NN team in Spain. Afterwards, I completed an analysis of the library.
